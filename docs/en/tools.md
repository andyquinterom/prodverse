tapLock is an R package that provides a simple yet powerful and secure way to
lock down Shiny applications and Plumber APIs with Single Sign-On (SSO). tapLock
uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol with OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate users
with many popular identity providers (IdPs) such as Google, Entra ID / Active
Directory, Auth0 and many more. tapLock uses a unique approach to secure Shiny
applications and Plumber APIs that requires no mayor changes to existing code.
